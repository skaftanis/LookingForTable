A common problem when you need to go out is that you never know if the restaurant or the coffee shop you want to visit is out of space. If it is, you need to change your plans and go somewhere else, maybe far away and the loop might continue. So, "Looking For Table" is the solutions. People who are already in a store can write the number of available spots. Also the store itself can do it with a special account. This way every people who want to go out, they will know where is more possible to find a table to spend their night.
